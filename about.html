            <br><p><h4>Samgyeopsal is a popular Korean dish known for its simplicity and delicious flavors. It consists of thick slices of pork belly,
                 which are grilled at the table and typically served with various accompaniments such as lettuce leaves, sliced garlic, green chili peppers, 
                                                          ssamjang (a spicy paste), and kimchi.</h4></p>
                  <br>
                 <p><h4>Traditionally, samgyeopsal is cooked on a grill placed in the center of the table, 
                    allowing diners to participate in the cooking process and customize their wraps or ssam (which means "wrapped" in Korean) to their liking.!</h4></p>
                    <br>
                 <p><h4>The combination of juicy, fatty pork belly with the crisp freshness of lettuce and the bold flavors of the accompanying condiments
                     creates a harmonious balance of textures and tastes that make samgyeopsal a favorite among both locals and visitors to Korea.</h4></p>
